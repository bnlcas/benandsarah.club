        <h3>Accomodation:</h3>
        <p>
            Sarah wanted to suggest a nice hotel for eveyone to stay out, but Ben thought it would be much easier for you to figure it out for yourself. This builds character and ensures that you are attending out of a sense of honor and responsibility despite the setbacks.
